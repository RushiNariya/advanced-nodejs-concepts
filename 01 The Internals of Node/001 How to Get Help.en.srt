Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,330
We're going to get started with the course in just a moment but before we do I want to tell you how

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,850
you can get help if you get stuck at any point during this course.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,200
So there's three great ways to reach out to me.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,870
The first is to post on the course discussion boards.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,760
I usually check the Course discussion about once a day on Monday through Friday so I'll do my best to

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,820
get back to you as soon as possible if anything comes up.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,490
The next best way to reach out to me is to send me a direct message on you to me.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,090
I'm usually very good about responding to these requests and usually better about that than with the

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,660
Course Q&amp;A.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,290
Finally you can reach out to me via Twitter.

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,840
And here's my handle listed right here.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,910
Twitter is a great way to reach out to me with short questions but if it's anything technical related

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,970
I usually recommend either posting on the course discussion or send me a PM because obviously with Twitter

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,100
we've got that character limit that makes technical discussions a little bit more challenging.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,420
All right.

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,120
So that's the three ways to get help if you ever get stuck during this course.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,700
Let's pause right now and we'll start talking about our first technical topic in the next video so I'll

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,340
see you in just a minute.
